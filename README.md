## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - where the history of your work (changes) are saved
 * Git - Version Control - helps organize and keep track of changes so that in situations of error, a working version is ready to be used
 * Clone - copies the fork of a repository to work on
 * Fork - duplicating someone's changes and then applying your own changes to it
 * History - tracks and compares changes of work from the past to present
 * Staging - getting changes ready to be committed and making sure all changes are saved
 * Remote - git's method of allowed others see the changes made to your repository and interact with it.
 * Commit - submitting to git the changes made and adding it to the history
 * Push - saves the changes committed to the master copy of the fork

## Steps to our Lamba School Git Flow

2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL 
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
